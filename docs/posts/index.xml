I was a little surprised, because though I‚Äôve gotten that comment before, it‚Äôs become normal for me to travel with just a small bag (10 lbs. or less, usually), and I have friends who travel with even less.</description></item><item><title>How to test dark mode?</title><link>https://qucciolo.github.io/posts/post-7/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Mar 2018 12:13:38 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://qucciolo.github.io/posts/post-7/</guid><description>Here is how you can setup dark mode for Ink and test on various OS like iOS, Android, macOS and Windows 10.</description></item><item><title>Typography</title><link>https://qucciolo.github.io/posts/post-5/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Mar 2018 12:13:38 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://qucciolo.github.io/posts/post-5/</guid><description>Lid est laborum et dolorum fuga.

The result is often a continual busyness, constant distraction and avoidance, lack of focus, lack of satisfaction with our lives.
We run from silence. We run from the spaces between tasks and appointments. We run from solitude and stillness.</description></item></channel></rss>
